# ID'S GUIDE

In the "ids of (...).md" files contains lists of the items and monsters, 
in those lists the ids are divide in "id", "name" and "number of codeline":

the "name" are the in-game names, what the player reads.

the "id" is the code name of the objetc, used in programming.

and the "number of codeline" is the number where's the id of the object.

And the lists are subcategorize in sub titles with a sub title like: #Items/Monsters/Corpses/Etc.

Every title represents a .json file in a specific folder of each mod with objects, 
so every objetc or monster of the Modular Turrets mod are in the "ids of Modular Turrets".

Some .md files do not contains the full list of every object of a mod, sometimes it's divide in two files, 
like for example the Civilian Robots and Modified Robots lists. 
it's because those two comes from the same mod but in diferent folders

Some items at the end of their line have the word: "(abstract)". 
that means the object is not a actual object that the game recognize but the code it contains yes, 
usually used as a way to create templates of a item to use the command `"looks_like": "example",`, 
a small thing that one shouldn't worry too much about but it's good to know if you're going to programm something based on my mods.
